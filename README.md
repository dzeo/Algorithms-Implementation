## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should run with no issues using SageMath *.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project was embarked upon to:

1. To understand and implement the underlying rationale bebind some modern algorithms
2. To develop and demonstrate  an intuition for algorithm design

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are several sage notebooks herein, each named after the algorithm it implements

1. Bird's_Algorithm.ipynb
2. Muller's_Method.ipynb
3. Polynomial factorization Distinct-degree factorization.ipynb
4. VAS.ipynb

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main results lies in the implementation of these algorithms
