## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should run with no issues using SageMath *.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project was embarked upon to:

1. To understand and implement the underlying rationale bebind some modern algorithms
2. To develop and demonstrate  an intuition for algorithm design

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are several sage notebooks herein, each named after the algorithm it implements
